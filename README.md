How to change the game:

keep in the data folder any background image and call it background.jpg. the screen size will adjust to the size of that image.

insert your own sound on/off icons by dropping the images into the data folder and calling sound on sound.png and sound off soundoff.png

use your own music. call the main soundtrack song.mp3 and call the noise that happens when the jellyfish are caught swoosh.wav

to use your own animated files instead of the jellyfish, add them to the data folder as .pngs with the same prefix and then their order number i.e. jelly000.gif, jelly001.gif, jelly002.gif
